The egonet_main.m file is where all the parameters for computing simplices and classification are input. The 
input_data folder contains the edges for each ego with weight as the last column, and the labels file.
Input files are all *.txt; output folder contains all the graphs for each ego and the resulting barcodes;
The bin folder contains all the files necessary to run the program.
The egonet_simplex.m file is used to find simplices in the network.
The egonet_bd.m file is used to compute barcodes and bottleneck distance.
