Hello Dr.

I've combined all into this little program for our research. This now can be handy to use!

The egonet_main.m file is where to input all the parameters for computing simplices and classification;
input_data folder contains the edges for each ego with weight as the last column, and the labels file;
input files are all *.txt;
output folder contains all the graphs for each ego and the resulted barcodes;
the bin folder contains all the files necessary to run the program;
the egonet_simplex.m file is used to find simplices in the network;
the egonet_bd.m file is used to compute barcodes and bottleneck distance;

I hope this program can be helpful for other research projects in future as well.

Thank you for guiding me all this time Dr.

I hope you enjoy this. If you have questions please let me know.

Minh Ng,
your student
